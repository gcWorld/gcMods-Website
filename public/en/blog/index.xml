      <description>As some of you have probably noticed by now is that the IBIScontrol updater no longer works. The reason behind this is that I recently moved the installation files from the old server to a new location without realising that the installer does a check of the installation files which now fails with the new location. Sadly, I do not have the source files of the installer any more and thus am unable to quickly fix this issue.</description>

      <description>The website is now also available in English. The language can be switched in the top right corner of the main menu. Please keep in mind that this is still a work in progress. At this time most of the downloads are not yet translated. They can still be downloaded on the German part of the website.</description>
