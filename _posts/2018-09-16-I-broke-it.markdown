As some of you have probably noticed by now is that the IBIScontrol updater no longer works. The reason behind this is that I recently moved the installation files from the old server to a new location without realising that the installer does a check of the installation files which now fails with the new location. Sadly, I do not have the source files of the installer any more and thus am unable to quickly fix this issue.

As such my current recommendation is to simply uninstall the Updater completly (No need to uninstall the plugin first if you want to keep using the plugin).

To keep using the plugin simply make sure it's still in your OMSI 2 plugins folder and launch OMSI 2 normally. You can grab a .zip file with the plugin files on the IBIScontrol download page.
